Goal

This project is a fully responsive and interactive developer portfolio designed to demonstrate my skills, highlight completed academic projects, and provide a professional point of contact for future opportunities. The purpose of the website is to showcase the work I have completed throughout my Master of Science in Software Development program, including JavaScript-based dynamic interfaces, TypeScript applications, and early React component development. The structure of the site is intentionally simple and efficient, focusing on clean navigation and an intuitive user experience.

Structure

The portfolio is organized into several key sections. The Home page introduces who I am and includes quick access to featured projects and my downloadable resume. The About page provides more personal background, including my professional interests and career goals. The Skills page lists core technical abilities that I have developed through education and practical work. The Projects page dynamically displays each completed assignment using JavaScript to populate card components from a data source, linking directly to their respective GitHub repositories for preview and review. The Contact page includes a form with real-time validation using DOM scripting to ensure clean and user-friendly interactions. The Resume page allows recruiters and hiring managers to scroll through or download my resume directly without leaving the site, ensuring convenient access.

Codebase
This website was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on DOM manipulation, reusable styling, and responsive design techniques. The project also features basic TypeScript integration to structure project data and demonstrate object-oriented principles learned in coursework. The site is deployed using GitHub Pages, making updates efficient through version-controlled development. The portfolio is designed not only as a course assignment but as a professional tool that will grow alongside my skillset as I progress further into software engineering and web development.

Overall, this portfolio represents my dedication to mastering modern web development technologies while providing a polished and accessible presentation of my work. It acts as a foundation for my journey into full-stack development and stands as an evolving showcase for future personal and professional projects.
