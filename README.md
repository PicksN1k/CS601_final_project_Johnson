## 🎯 Goal

This project is a fully responsive and interactive developer portfolio designed to demonstrate my technical skills, highlight completed academic assignments, and provide a professional platform for future networking and opportunities. The website showcases work completed during my Master of Science in Software Development program including JavaScript-based interfaces, TypeScript applications, and introductory React development. Its structure focuses on clean navigation, intuitive user experience, and accessible content display.

## 📌 Structure

The portfolio is organized into several key sections:

- **Home:** Introduces my role and goals as a software developer while offering quick access to featured work and a downloadable resume.
- **About:** Provides professional background and interests that drive my career in technology.
- **Skills:** Lists core technologies, tools, and programming experience developed through coursework and practical application.
- **Projects:** Dynamically displays completed assignments using JavaScript to populate reusable project card components from structured data. Each card links directly to the corresponding GitHub repository for review.
- **Contact:** Interactive form featuring real-time validation using DOM scripting to ensure clear and accurate user input.
- **Resume:** Embedded PDF viewer allowing visitors to scroll or download my resume directly without leaving the site.

This layout ensures efficient access to my qualifications and accomplishments while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
