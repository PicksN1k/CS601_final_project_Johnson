                <h2 class="accent">Software Developer</h2>

                <p>
                    I’m Cole Johnson — a passionate and motivated Software Developer currently pursuing my Master of Science 
                    in Software Development at Boston University. I love building meaningful applications that emphasize
                    usability, performance, and clean design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I focus on full-stack development using modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and React — and I enjoy solving 
                    challenges through thoughtful application architecture and strong problem-solving fundamentals. 
                    I’m constantly learning and improving, especially in cloud technologies and scalable system design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and taking on ambitious personal 
                    projects that help me grow as both a developer and a creator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have professional office experience working in fast-paced environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams,
                    and delivering high-quality solutions on time. Much of my previos experience involves customer service, and finance roles.
                    I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for technology to contribute to innovative projects and make a positive impact in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!
                </p>
